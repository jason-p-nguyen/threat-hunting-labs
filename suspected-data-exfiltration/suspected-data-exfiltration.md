# Threat Hunting: Suspicious Use of 7-Zip and Possible Data Exfiltration

**Author**: Jason Nguyen

**Tools & Technologies Used**:
- Microsoft Azure
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Azure Log Analytics
- KQL (Kusto Query Language)
- PowerShell
- GitHub (Markdown, Repo Management)

## üïµÔ∏è Summary

During routine threat hunting activity using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), I detected suspicious file archiving behavior followed by possible data exfiltration. PowerShell was used to silently install 7-Zip, which was then used to compress employee data. Shortly afterward, the archive appeared to be staged in a ‚Äúback up‚Äù folder and a network connection to an external URL was observed. This may indicate unauthorized data exfiltration.

## üóÇÔ∏è Investigation Steps

### üîç Step 1: Searching for ZIP File Creation Events

I first searched for `.zip` file activity using the `DeviceFileEvents` table:

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == "windows-target-1"
| where FileName endswith ".zip"
| order by Timestamp desc
````

![DeviceFileEvents](images/devicefileevents.png)

This showed multiple zip files being created and moved to a suspiciously named folder (‚Äúback up‚Äù).

### üîç Step 2: Investigating Process Activity Around ZIP File Creation

I took the timestamp from one of the `.zip` events and examined the `DeviceProcessEvents` within a 2-minute window before and after:

```kql
let VMName = "windows-target-1";
let specificTime = datetime(2025-06-10T12:49:51.4927429Z);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 2m) .. (specificTime + 2m))
| where DeviceName == VMName
| order by Timestamp desc
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, ProcessCommandLine
```
![DeviceProcessEvents](images/deviceprocessevents.png)

This revealed that PowerShell silently installed 7-Zip and subsequently used it to archive sensitive employee data.

### üîç Step 3: Investigating Potential Data Exfiltration

I then reviewed outbound network traffic within the same timeframe:

```kql
let VMName = "windows-target-1";
let specificTime = datetime(2025-06-10T12:49:51.4927429Z);
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 2m) .. (specificTime + 2m))
| where DeviceName == VMName
| order by Timestamp desc
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, RemoteIP, RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
```
![DeviceNetworkEvents](images/devicenetworkevents.png)

A successful connection to an external URL was found, suggesting the archived file may have been exfiltrated from the environment. The script used to build this lab confirmed that exfiltration was part of the intended behavior.

## üõ°Ô∏è Response Actions

* üîí Isolated the endpoint.
* üîî Created a detection rule for repeated `.zip` file creation within a 10-minute window.
* üì£ Notified the employee‚Äôs manager of:

  * PowerShell usage to automate 7-Zip installation and archiving.
  * Regular zip file creation and movement to a "back up" folder.
  * Evidence of external communication via network logs.

Awaiting further instructions from management.

## üìé Notes

* If not for reviewing the lab environment‚Äôs script, I may have missed the significance of the `RemoteUrl` field ‚Äî this helped confirm data was sent externally.
* This investigation emphasized the importance of correlating **file events**, **process activity**, and **network logs** with a clear timeline.
* Screenshots and KQL outputs have been archived locally.
* This report is part of my cybersecurity learning portfolio from Josh Madakor's Cyber Range.
