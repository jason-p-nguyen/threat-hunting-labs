# üõ°Ô∏è Threat Hunt: Sudden Network Slowdowns ‚Äì Port Scan Investigation

## üìÖ Scenario Summary: 
While investigating reports of **sudden internal network slowdowns**, I observed anomalous behavior from a Windows 10 VM (`j-win10`) including **several failed connection attempts** to internal hosts. Using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) and KQL queries, I was able to trace the issue to an unexpected **PowerShell-based port scan** initiated by the SYSTEM account.

## üß≠ Timeline of Investigation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Indicator: Failed Network Connections
```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName == "j-win10"
| where ActionType == "ConnectionFailed"
| summarize ConnectionCount = count() by DeviceName, ActionType, LocalIP, RemoteIP
| order by ConnectionCount
```
üìù **Observation**: High volume of failed connections from `10.0.0.133`, targeting itself and another internal host.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Behavioral Analysis: Sequential Port Scanning
```kql
let IPInQuestion = "10.0.0.133";
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where ActionType == "ConnectionFailed"
| where LocalIP == IPInQuestion
| order by Timestamp desc
```
üìù **Finding**: Sequential port attempts suggest a **port scanning** operation.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Process Correlation: Identifying the Source
```kql
let VMName = "j-win10";
let specificTime = datetime(2025-06-08T08:39:07.1275438Z);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 10m) .. (specificTime + 10m))
| where DeviceName == VMName
| order by Timestamp desc
| project Timestamp, FileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
```
üìù **Finding**: A script named `portscan.ps1` was executed via `powershell.exe`.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Manual Inspection: Confirming Malicious Script
Logged into the host and confirmed presence of the following script:

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Privilege Concern: SYSTEM-Level Execution
```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 10m) .. (specificTime + 10m))
| where DeviceName == VMName
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine contains "portscan"
| order by Timestamp desc
| project Timestamp, FileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, AccountName
```
üìù **Red Flag**: The script was run by the `SYSTEM` account‚Äî**not expected** and not admin-configured.

> üì∑ *[Proof of device isolation]*  
> üì∑ *[Proof of antivirus scan]*

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Remediation Actions
- ‚úÖ **Isolated** the device in Microsoft Defender.
- ‚úÖ **Ran antivirus/malware scan** ‚Äì no detections.
- ‚úÖ **Escalated for rebuild** due to privilege misuse and uncertainty around persistence.

## üß† MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| Tactic               | Technique                                 | ID          | Description |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Execution            | PowerShell                                | T1059.001   | Port scan script executed via PowerShell |
| Execution / Priv. Esc.| Service Execution                        | T1569.002   | SYSTEM account used to run the script |
| Discovery            | Network Service Discovery                 | T1046       | Targeted internal services using port scan |
| Discovery            | Remote System Discovery                   | T1018       | Attempted to identify other hosts |
| Discovery            | System Network Configuration Discovery    | T1016       | Likely goal of scanning activity |
| Priv. Escalation     | Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism         | T1548.002   | SYSTEM-level execution suspicious (potential UAC bypass or service hijack) |

## ‚úÖ Skills Demonstrated
- KQL threat hunting across Defender tables (`DeviceNetworkEvents`, `DeviceProcessEvents`)
- Identifying and tracing suspicious behavior across logs
- Manual validation via script inspection
- Device isolation and escalation procedures
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping and incident documentation
