# üß† Threat Hunt Ideas

A running list of threat hunting scenarios to explore, simulate, or build projects around. Based on real-world techniques, malware behavior, and threat actor tactics.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed

- **TOR Browser Usage**  
  Unauthorized use of the TOR browser for anonymous browsing or evasion of web filters.

---

## üîç In Progress / Next Up

- **Firefox Installation on Corporate Device**  
  Detect installation and use of an unapproved browser like Firefox on a managed system.

- **Dropbox Data Exfiltration**  
  Large sensitive file uploaded to unauthorized cloud storage (Dropbox).

- **USB Malware Execution (PowerShell)**  
  A USB device is inserted, running a malicious `Invoke-WebRequest` payload via PowerShell.

- **Chrome Extension Persistence**  
  Malicious browser extension used to establish backdoor access or maintain persistence.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Scenarios to Build

- **LOLBins Abuse**  
  User abuses legitimate Windows tools like `certutil.exe` or `mshta.exe` to download and execute a payload.

- **Privileged Escalation**  
  User gains admin privileges via a misconfiguration or known exploit on the system.

- **PowerShell Abuse**  
  Use of suspicious PowerShell commands like `Invoke-WebRequest` or encoded base64 strings.

- **Hidden Persistence via Scheduled Task**  
  Attacker schedules a hidden task to run malware after reboot.

- **USB Keylogger or Autorun Attack**  
  Hidden device emulates a keyboard or auto-executes a payload upon insertion.

- **Remote Desktop Software Installed**  
  User installs AnyDesk/TeamViewer without approval to allow external remote access.

- **Macro-Based Email Attack**  
  Phishing email attachment with macro-enabled Word/Excel file initiating malicious code.

- **Bypassing Application Whitelisting**  
  Attacker runs payloads from non-whitelisted paths or uses scripting engines.

## üéß Inspired by Darknet Diaries

- **Evercookie Tracking (Samy Kamkar)**  
  A persistent cookie mechanism that survives regular deletion via multiple vectors.

- **PoisonTap Device Attack**  
  $5 Raspberry Pi device simulates network and intercepts HTTP traffic via USB.

- **KeySweeper (Samy Kamkar)**  
  USB wall charger that secretly logs and transmits keystrokes from wireless keyboards.

- **SRF Vulnerability Abuse**  
  Exploiting server-side request forgery to pivot internally or expose internal resources.

- **Bug Bounty Writeup Replication**  
  Recreate and hunt real findings from public bug bounty disclosures.

---

## üåê Linux / Endpoint-Focused Scenarios

- **Unauthorized Package Installation (Linux)**  
  Detect installation of `nmap`, `netcat`, or other hacking tools on a Linux endpoint.

- **User Enumeration or Privilege Discovery**  
  Suspicious enumeration commands (`whoami`, `id`, `sudo -l`, etc.) on Linux system.

- **SSH Brute-Force Attempts**  
  Detect repeated failed SSH login attempts or anomalous access patterns.

---

## üìå To Brainstorm or Research Further

- USB firmware-level threats  
- Insider threat with scheduled file deletion  
- Malware that disables security tools (Defender, Sentinel)  
- Fake VPN apps used as backdoors  
- Cryptominer dropped in temp folder via phishing

> ‚úçÔ∏è Tip: When starting a hunt, always define a scenario, log source, expected IOCs, and what success looks like.
